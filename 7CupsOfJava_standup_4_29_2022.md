For the most part I was able to follow along in terms of Java. I am hopeful with learning more Java. I plan to start a huge part of my p0 over the weekend.

Java was pretty lengthy. I did do some self-study with other group members. I plan to use this weekend to study quizlet and work on my p0 project.

I started diving into Git by studying and practicing more. I'm now looking into getting SQL up to a level three (3) standardization form.

Java is similar to JavaScript so I was able to understand some of it. I might have to go back to the videos to understand more of SQL and Java.
